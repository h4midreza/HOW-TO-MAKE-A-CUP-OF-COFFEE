- easure your coffee- use 1 tablespoons of ground coffee for each cup.
- Water temperature needs to be between 90 - 95 degree. If you boil water let it sit for 30 seconds before using it.
- Rinse your filter with hot water before brewing.
- Pour just enough water over the grounds to let them bloom (they get puffy). After 20-30 seconds continue the pour over. This will get the most flavor from your coffee.
