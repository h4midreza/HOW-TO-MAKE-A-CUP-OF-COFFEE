Making the perfect cup of coffee can be as complicated or as easy as you like. What you have to remember is it’s going to be perfect for your taste and your lifestyle.
That can mean elaborate equipment, grinders, and temperature controls. But tech junkie or coffee connoisseur, you can still make an amazing cup of coffee with a cone and filter if you just follow some simple guidelines.

- Use cold filtered water.
- easure your coffee- use 1 tablespoons of ground coffee for each cup.
- Water temperature needs to be between 90 - 95 degree. If you boil water let it sit for 30 seconds before using it.
- Rinse your filter with hot water before brewing.
- Pour just enough water over the grounds to let them bloom (they get puffy). After 20-30 seconds continue the pour over. This will get the most flavor from your coffee.
- Drink your freshly brewed coffee within 30 minutes of brewing. Don’t let coffee sit in a pot all day long. Make it as you need it.
